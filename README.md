# Classic Sliding Mode Control On A Third Degree System With 3 Uncertain Parameters

This project is a solution to homework 2 of my fault detection and control university course. The simulation of this project was done with simulink in the SlidingMode_HW2.slx file. Also, the report (in persian) for this project is in the Fault-SMC-HW2 Report.pdf file that expresses the problem and the solution completely.

This project is about implementing the classic sliding mode method for controling a third degree nonlinear system stated in the report that has 3 uncertain paramters. The first chapter is about designing the sliding mode controller and its parameters. And finally, the second chapter is devoted to simulation and its resluts. The results show that tracking was done perfectly but with the cost of creating the chattering phenomenon and a big overshoot in the initial moments for the control and error vectors.
